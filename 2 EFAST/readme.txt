1. The Sampling folder is used to generate parameter sets according to EFAST sampling strategy.
2. Similar to DHSVM_ANOVA, the generated parameter sets are put into DHSVM to simulate streamflow series.
3. dailyflow.c is used to extract streamflow on a certain day from different sets.
4. sensitivity.m is used to calculate the sensitiivity index for each day.
