/*****************************************************************************
Function name: WaterTableDepth()

Purpose      :   This function calculates the depth of the water table
below the ground surface, based on the amount of soil
moisture in the root zone layers.

Required     :
int NRootLayers  - Number of soil layers
float TotalDepth - Total depth of the soil profile (m)
float *RootDepth - Depth of each of the soil layers (m)
float *Porosity  - Porosity of each soil layer
float *FCap      - Field capacity of each soil layer
float *Adjust    - Correction for each layer for loss of soil storage
due to channel/road-cut.  Multiplied with RootDepth
to give the layer thickness for use in calculating
soil moisture

Returns      :
float TableDepth - Depth of the water table below the soil surface

Modifies     :
float *Moist - Amount of soil moisture in each layer

Comments     :
Since no unsaturated flow is allowed to occur when the moisture content
is below the field capacity, and because lateral saturated flow is the
only mechanism by which water can disappear from the soil below the
deepest root layer, the soil moisture content in the soil below the
deepest root layer can never fall below field capacity.  The water
immediately above the water table is assumed to be at field capacity.

Changes have been made to account for the potential loss of soil storage
in a grid cell due to a road-cut or channel.

    /* Based on a single bad parameter in a DHSVM input file (a third layer
    vertical hydraulic conductivity that was 10 times smaller than the layer
    above it), it was noted that DHSVM can develop what are basically perched
    water tables.  These perched water tables greatly complicate the calculation
    of the pixel water table depth because the soil below the perched table
    is not completely saturated above field capacity.
    For example, if we have three soil layers and a deep layer, all 1 meter thick,
    and we saturate the second layer from the surface, what is, or should be, the water
    table depth. Should we allow subsurface flow to occur, should we include the saturation
    of disconnected overlying layers in the calculation of the hydraulic gradient.
    At this point, just be cautious.  Using any combination of soil parameters or
    intial water states which can cause the lower layers of the soil profile
    to drain more quickly than water can flow down through the matrix will
    result in mass balance problems.  I.e. water will be forced out of the cell
    to the downslope, this water will be taken from the deepest soil layer, which
    can cause the deep layer soil moisture to go negative. */
