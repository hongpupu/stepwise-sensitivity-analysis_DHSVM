Returns      : none

Modifies     :

float *IntRain         - Intercepted rain (m)

Comments     : Only the top canopy layer is taken into account for snow
interception.  Snow interception by lower canopy is
disregarded.  Rain water CAN be intercepted by lower canopy
layers (similar to InterceptionStorage()).
Of course:  NO vegetation -> NO interception
