Function name: UnsaturatedFlow()

Purpose      : Calculate the unsaturated flow in the soil column, and
adjust the moisture in each soil layer

Required     :
int Dt             - Time step (seconds)
float DX           - Grid cell width (m)
float DY           - Grid cell width (m)
float Infiltration - Amount of infiltration entering the top of the soil
column (m)
float RoadbedInfiltration - Amount of infiltration through the roadbed(m)
float SatFlow      - Amount of saturated flow entering the soil column
from neighbouring pixels (m)
int NSoilLayers    - Number of soil layers
float TotalDepth   - Total depth of the soil profile (m)
float Area         - Area of channel or road surface (m)
float *RootDepth   - Depth of each of the soil layers (m)
float *Ks          - Vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity in each
soil layer (m/s)
float *PoreDist    - Pore size distribution index for each soil layer
float *Porosity    - Porosity of each soil layer
float *FCap        - Field capacity of each soil layer
float *Perc        - Amount of water percolating from each soil layer to
the layer below (m)
float *PercArea    - Area of the bottom of each soil layer as a fraction
of the gridcell area DX*DY
float *Adjust      - Correction for each layer for loss of soil storage
due to channel/road-cut.  Multiplied with RootDepth
to give the layer thickness for use in calculating


soil moisture
int CutBankZone    - Number of the soil layer containing the bottom of

the cut-bank
float BankHeight   - Distance from ground surface to channel bed or
bottom of road-cut (m)

Returns      : void

Modifies     :
float *TableDepth - Depth of the water table below the ground surface (m)
float *RunOff     - Amount of runoff produced at the pixel (m)
float *Moist      - Moisture content in each soil layer

This function is based on Wigmosta et al [1994], and assumes a unit
hydraulic gradient in the unsaturated zone.  This implies a
steady-state situation and uniform moisture distribution.  This is not
unreasonable for situations where the groundwater is fairly deep
[Bras, 1990], but may be unrealistic for the boreal forest system, or
other similar situations where the groundwater table is relatively close
to the surface. The current formulation does not allow for upward
movement of water in the unsaturated zone, by capillary and matrix
forces.  No unsaturated flux is assumed to occur if the water content
drops below the field capacity.

The unsaturated hydraulic conductivity is calculated using the
Brooks-Corey equation see for example Wigmosta et al. [1994], eq.41

The calculated amount of drainage is averaged with the amount calculated
for the previous timestep, see eq. 42 [Wigmosta et al., 1994].


The residual moisture content is assumed to be zero (easy to adapt if
needed).

If the amount of soil moisture in a layer after drainage still
exceeds the porosity for that layer, this additional amount of water is
added to the drainage to the next layer.


CHANGES:


Changes have been made to account for the potental loss of soil storage
in a grid cell due to a road-cut or channel.  Correction coefficents are
calculated in AdjustStorage() and CutBankGeometry()
